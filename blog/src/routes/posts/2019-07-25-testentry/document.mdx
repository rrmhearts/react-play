## Testing this blog site.
**To create a new post,** add a new directory to `src/pages/posts` that is prefixed with the new post's publication date, then create a `post.js` file inside it:

```jsx
export default {
  title: `Learn How To Build This Blog From Scratch`,
  tags: ['react', 'navi'],
  spoiler: "An online course with loads of live demos and exercises.",
  getContent: () => import('./document.mdx'),
}
```
This seemed to have worked better than I originally thought.
